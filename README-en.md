The Space Marker project is part of the evaluation process for the subject Computational Thinking in Computer Science - Atitus 2023/01, which is included in the Data Science Block of the course. The project consists of applying all the methodologies taught in the classroom and aiming to improve the algorithm, while following the guidelines and instructions provided for its functionality.<br><br>

    <a>Project Instructions</a>
</h2>
The solution involves marking points on an image obtained from the James Webb Space Telescope. The user should analyze the image and, upon clicking with the mouse, be prompted to enter the name of the star. After this process, a point with the star's name should be created on the image. With the second marking, the system should draw a straight line between the two points. The project's images and sounds have been provided by the professor, along with other instructions for completing the project, which have been analyzed and implemented.
<h2 align="center"><a>Functionalities</a></h2>
<ul>
	<li> Language Selection Menu (English and Portuguese); </li>
	<li> Point Marking with Names; </li>
	<li> If no name is provided, the point is named "Unknown" + its coordinate value; </li>
	<li> A line is drawn between two marked points; </li>
	<li> The sum of the coordinates between the two points is calculated; </li>
	<li> Option to save, load, or delete the made markings; </li>
	<li> When closing the application, the markings are saved.</li>
</ul>

	<a>How to Execute the Project</a>
</h2>
There are two ways to run the project. The first, which is the simplest, is by downloading the file "<b>Space Marker.rar</b>", <a href=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-qgwCtACELOz1Y9QP9JIJZZhCLrxABfp/view?usp/>clicking here</a>.
<br> Unzip the file <code>Space Marker.rar</code> and execute the <code>Space Marker.exe</code>.<br>
Another way to run the project is by downloading the files directly from the Git repository and running it via the command prompt. For this, you need to have Python 3 language and the Pygame library installed. To download the Python language, <a href=https://www.python.org/>click here</a>. To install Pygame, you need to have PIP installed, which comes with the Python language. Additionally, you need to execute the following command in the command prompt:
<br><br>

```
 pip install pygame
```

To run the project, you need to open the command prompt within the main project folder and execute the command:

```
 py main.py
```
